List of DS Practical
1.	Write a C program to Implementation Stack Using Array.
2.	Write a C program to Implementation queue Using Array.
3.	Write a C program to convert infix expression into postfix expression.
4.	Write a C program to evaluate any postfix expression.
5.	Create a Single Linked List with  pointers  left &   right where new nodes are always added after the  right. Then user will input a key that should be searched in the linked list & the element having the key value should be deleted & linked list should be updated. If element is not found, then a message "Unsuccessful Search" should be displayed.
6.	Write a program to search a node from a linked list.
